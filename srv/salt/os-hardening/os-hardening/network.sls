# arp_announce - INTEGER
# Define different restriction levels for announcing the local source IP
# address from IP packets in ARP requests sent on interface:
#
# * **0** - (default) Use any local address, configured on any interface
#
# * **1** - Try to avoid local addresses that are not in the target's subnet
# for this interface. This mode is useful when target hosts reachable via this
# interface require the source IP address in ARP requests to be part of their
# logical network configured on the receiving interface. When we generate the
# request we will check all our subnets that include the target IP and will
# preserve the source address if it is from such subnet. If there is no such
# subnet we select source address according to the rules for level 2.
#
# * **2** - Always use the best local address for this target. In this mode we
# ignore the source address in the IP packet and try to select local address
# that we prefer for talks with the target host. Such local address is selected
# by looking for primary IP addresses on all our subnets on the outgoing
# interface that include the target IP address. If no suitable local address is
# found we select the first local address we have on the outgoing interface or
# on all other interfaces, with the hope we will receive reply for our request
# and even sometimes no matter the source IP address we announce.
